Usage

Create a geomap:

2. Type in the topicmap name and choose *Geomap* from the Type menu.

3. Press *Create*. The geomap appears.

Place markers on the geomap:

* Create a Person or Institution topic, and type in its address. Once you press the *Save* button a corresponding marker is placed on the geomap.

* Reveal an existing Person or Institution by performing a search. Once you click a result item a corresponding marker is placed on the geomap.

Get information about a marker:

* Just click the marker. You see the underlying topic's detail information in the right-side panel.

Note: geomaps are working also for your self-defined domain types. Just add the *Address* topic type to your type definition. (The Address topic type is provided by the Contacts plugin which is part of the DeepaMehta standard distribution.)
